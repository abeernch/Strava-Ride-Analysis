### Project Description: Analyzing Personal Workout Data from Strava

**Project Title:**  
**Strava Data Analysis and Visualization Project: Building an Interactive Health Dashboard**

**Objective:**  
The primary objective of this project is to build a comprehensive skillset in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical data analysis, and data preparation/cleaning/preprocessing using Python and Power BI. This will be achieved by analyzing my personal workout data logged on Strava since 2021. The project will involve downloading and programmatically segregating thousands of workout files, focusing primarily on analyzing bicycle rides. The end goal is to visualize the data interactively and create a health dashboard similar to the Apple and Samsung Health Apps.

**Project Scope:**
1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   - **Download Strava Data:** All workout files logged since 2021 will be downloaded in .tcx format, which includes various types of workouts such as runs, bicycle rides, hikes, swims, and gym sessions.
  
2. **Data Segregation:**  
   - **Programmatic Segregation:** Use Python to programmatically segregate the files based on the type of workout. This will involve developing an algorithm that efficiently identifies and categorizes different types of workouts from thousands of files.

3. **Data Preparation:**  
   - **Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning and preprocessing it. This will include handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and converting the data into a format suitable for statistical analysis.
   - **Extraction and Parsing:** Utilize packages such as `datetime`, `regex`, `shutil`, `numpy`, and `pandas` to extract, parse, and transform the information from .gpx files into structured datasets.
  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - **Statistical and Aggregate Analysis:** Perform EDA to gain insights into the bicycle ride data. This will include calculating metrics such as total distance covered, average speed, elevation gain, time duration, and other relevant statistics. 
   - **Visual Data Exploration:** Use libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` to create visualizations that uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.

5. **Data Visualization & Interactive Reporting:**  
   - **Power BI Integration:** Leverage Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that presents the analyzed data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will be designed to mimic the functionality and design of health apps like Apple Health and Samsung Health.
   - **Dynamic Reports:** Generate dynamic reports that allow users to explore the data by filtering by date range, type of ride, and other customizable parameters.

6. **Health Dashboard Development:**  
   - **Dashboard Design:** Develop a fully interactive health dashboard using Power BI, showcasing key insights such as performance over time, comparison between different periods, and personalized health metrics.
   - **User Experience (UX):** Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and easy to navigate, providing users with actionable insights and a clear overview of their cycling activities and progress over time.

**Learning Goals:**
- **Efficient Coding Practices:** Develop efficient coding strategies for handling large datasets and automating repetitive tasks.
- **Package Utilization:** Gain hands-on experience with Python packages such as `datetime`, `regex`, `shutil`, `numpy`, and `pandas`, learning how to extract, parse, and manipulate data from various file formats.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Enhance skills in EDA, statistical analysis, and data visualization, using tools like Python and Power BI to derive meaningful insights from the data.
- **Interactive Reporting:** Learn how to build interactive dashboards that provide dynamic and engaging ways to explore and present data.
- **Python Development:** Showcase proficiency in Python development by creating reusable, modular code that can be applied to similar data analysis projects in the future.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A well-organized, clean dataset of bicycle ride data extracted from Strava logs.
- In-depth statistical analysis and visualizations that reveal insights into cycling performance and trends.
- A fully interactive health dashboard that serves as a personalized tool for monitoring and improving cycling activities.
- A portfolio project that demonstrates expertise in Python programming, data analysis, and dashboard creation, highlighting skills that are valuable in data science and analytics roles.
