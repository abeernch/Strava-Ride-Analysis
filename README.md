# Strava-Ride-Analysis
Analyzing my personal workout data logged on Strava since 2021. The project will involve downloading and programmatically segregating thousands of workout files, focusing primarily on analyzing bicycle rides. The end goal is to visualize the data interactively and create a health dashboard similar to the Apple and Samsung Health Apps.
